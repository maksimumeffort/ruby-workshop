#Dealer hitting rules
  # the dealer's hand is not complete until all players have either received blackjack, busted, or stayed.
  # When the cards are dealt at the beginning of the round the dealer will draw 2 cards for themselves and one card will be hidden.
  # After all, players go, the dealer will then reveal the hidden card and will hit until they are at or higher than 17. At which point the dealer will stay.
  # Some tables will or online sites will have the dealer stop in Blackjack at 16, so make sure you read the table's rules
